In our country some dishonest shop owner take vat from us but didn't pay back to government due to lack of our proper knowledge in vat.Some of them don't have BIN (Business Identification Number) . Some of them use fake or others BIN (Business Identification Number) in order to provide fake vat chalan. So, it's high time to stop them. Grab the app and check their BIN which mentioned in the bill (if you asked chalan from them, you'll see their BIN in their chalan). If their bin is fake , report them back to the government and government will take proper step. Now government are giving reward to the people who reported about these dishonest owner so why "suvo kaje deri ? ". You'll get every info from this app. 

After all "Amra Jodi na jagi na ma kemne sokal hbe ?" .
